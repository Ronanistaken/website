            <i> week 1 8/20/23 </i> My name is Ronan Fisher and this is my epic journal entree about my experiences in engeering.<br>
            This first week started with me and my fellow classmates indulging in a challenge of wits.<br>
            The purpose of the challenge was to test our ability to work as a team to achieve a single goal. <br>
            The objectve was to roll a marble into a bucket without it rolling backwords using only short half cut pvc pipes. <br>
            We started great being far ahead of the opposing team, almost getting to the bucket every time.<br>
            To our dismay the other team suddenly improoved at a rapid rate causing us to panic which gave them the advantage resulting in our defeat.<br>
            Even though we lost it was a great lesson to us on why it is important to learn from our mistakes.<br>
            our mistake was that every time we got close to the bucket the person in charge would not angle the ramp properly so it would just miss. <br>

            <i> week 2 8/27/23 </i> This is my seccond week of school and it consisted of learning tinkercad,, mechanical engeneering, and drafting our rube goldberg machiene. <br>
            We learned about machanical engineering which i don't remember much of, but im sure we learnt about the uses and the different organizations. <br>
            I was absent for the day we learnt about the tinkercad, but that does'nt matter because i already have experience with it from another class. <br>
            The idea for our rube goldberg machiene was my idea and i thought of it because the last project i bult was a roller coater and it was kind of similar. <br>

        <p>
            <i>week 3 9/5/23</i> this is my third week of school and wee started to buld our rude goldberg machiene<br>
            in our first phase of bulding we spent the intire time cutting pieces of cardboard to buld when we had all the pieces of a specific part we just bult that part then moved on<br>
            we bult a box for the car to sit in and the first rap that are baseball would roll down our only challenge with bulding was making the box because micheal deided to ct the shape then fold the corners in instead of just cutting the sides then taping them together<br>
            our only problem on tinkercad was creating the corners that the car would go around. this was a problem because we wanted the car to use the rounded corner to slide around the corner<br>
            we solved this problem by getting a circle and stretching it out so that we could make a hole in a rectangle creating a rounded corner<br>
            we also could not dissighn the string for the pully because there was no option that we could find that would make that shape in tinkercad<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>week 4 9/11/23</i> this is my fourth week of school and we spent teh time finishing our rude goldberg machine and testing it<br>
            we bult the pully by cutting circles of cardboard and impaleing then all together with a paperclip. then we put two bigger curcles pn the outside that would keep the string guided<br>
            the pully was held up by other pieces of cardboard with supports and the legs were taped to the base. the string would glide on top of tape to reduce friction<br>
            our only problem was that the baseball was not heavy enough to lif the car we were using so the project did not work at first<br>
            we tried multiple ideas to try to make it work but nothing seemed to make a difference because the car was just to heavy and the cather was not big enough to allow us to add weight to the pully<br>
            we were then blessed with a smaller car but our dissighn was still to complicated for the amount of time that we had. so we simplifed it so that the car would just be lifted on a ramp that would lead it to a baloon<br>
            this worked and we were able to get the project done. the eliments that we used to buld it were incline plane, pully, wheel and axle (car).<br>

            <i>week 5 9/18/23</i> this is my fifth week of school and it consisted of creating a flotation divice made out of one peiece of paper and creating a paper E acording to a classmates instructions<br>
            my floatation divice was extremely simple, i just folded the sides of a sheat of paper in to create a box. then i added 76.1 grams of weight to the box to see how long it could float<br>
            it floated for the meximum amount of time which was five minutes. I was kind of luckey though because my box had a hole in the bottom that allowed water in. the reason im luckey is because the weight pluged the hole allowing it to float<br>
            for the paper E my partner gave the worst instructions ever which made everything more difficult. the top and bottem length for the E was half a centimeter different which made making the side a lot more difficult.<br>
            there messurement were extremely specific but in a bad way that just caused me to have problems. it worked out though and i was able to complete it.

            <i>week 11 10/30 - 11/3</i> This is my eleventh week of school and it consisted of learning about electrical engineering and creating circut boards on tinkercad<br>
            the worksheet was very confusing at first but after my fellow classmate explaned it to me it became extreamly easy.<br>
            we then moved on to the labs. the first lab took a bit to understand but even after i compleated it i was not sure on why it worked.<br>
            i then moved on to the seccond lab where i was stumped. i didn't understand anything but after playing around with it a little i figured it out.<br>
            the seccond lab we very easy but i ran into a problem that i didn't understand the last two LED's would light up, but the first one wouldn't.<br>
            so i seaked out help from Ms.Petrosian she explaned my problem which was i was connecting the positive part of the LED to the other instead of the negitive to the positive.<br>
            after i understood this i compleated the extra exersise easily.<br>

            <i> week 13 11/16/23 </i> This is my thirteenth week of school and it consisted of finishing our circut boards and learning about business engeering. <br>
            The problem that we faced when coding the circut boards was solved by downloading an app, but after we did that the coding was very easy.<br>
            After i finished coding i went to help my friend michael with his code, the first thing that i checked was that he did everything correctly which he did<br>
            That narrowed it down to only three possibilities the first was the arduino was not working, the seccond was that his computer wasn't working and the third was that his acount wasn't working.<br>
            I brought my computer over and let him sighn into it and the arduino still didn't waork so I sighnd in and it worked.<br>
            the problem was solved so i let him use my computer for the rest of class.<br>
            the engeneering worksheet was very easy.<br>

            <i>week 14 11/30/23</i>This is my fourteenth week of school and it consisted of finishing our buissiness idea and presenting to the class<br>
            the product we decided to do was a cooking pot that had deviders so you could cook two seprate meals at once.<br>
            I created a TinkerCad of the design and it was extreamly easy to make it only took about eight minutes and it realy coveyed my thaught process<br>
            there was not much information on the internet about the cost to make the pot so we decided to make the price up based on the information that we could find on the price of cast iron<br>
            after presenting there were a few questions that made me rethink the desighn and one of them was "wouldnt cast iron be heavy" this is an obvious oversight by us and after consideration we will be making the pots out of stainless steel<br>

            <i>week 15 9/8/24</i><br>
            1. What was the weight of your bridge?<br>
            the weight of our first bridge was 48.6 grams which made sense because it was a flatter design<br>
            the weight of our seccond bridge was 89.9 grams
            2. What was the weight held by your bridge?<br>
            3. What was the ratio of weight of bridge to weight held? <br>
            4. What was the heaviest part of your bridge? What contributed most to the weight?<br>
            5. Where did the design of your bridge come from? Inspiration? Research? <br>
            the design for our seccond bridge inspired by our reaserch and basic understanding of how to buld a bridge<br>
            the design for our first bridge was not our origional design, it was inspred by the designs other people were doing<br>
            6. Did the design work as intended? Better? Worse?<br>
            our first bridge design was not as strong as we intended but made a lot of sense as to why most bridges look similar<br>
            our seccond bridge exeaded our expectations because the bridge looked brittle bust turned out to be very strong<br>
            my hypothesis is that a flat bridge design is better for short distances and uses less materials but for larger gaps the arched bridge has stronger support which makes it better<br>
            7. What was the point of failure of your bridge? Was that the expected weakest point?<br>
            8. What can you do to improve your bridge? What can prolong points of failure?<br>
            9. Post building progress photos of your bridge<br>
            10. Post photos of before your bridge (many photos)<br>
            11. Post a video of your bridge<br>

            <i> Semester 2 </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i> S2 week 1 1/8-1/12</i>this is my first week back from winter break and it consisted of updating my website, learning about chemical engeering and creating oobleck<br>
            on the first day back i had trouble logging in because of a lack of communication between my first period teacher<br>
            she did not tell us how to get a new password, instead she just instructed us to log in so when i logged in using common sense i ran into an error<br>
            i told her my error and she put my name into a doc for kids who can't log in. when engeering rolled around i had to log into my computer so ms. petrosian taught me how to reset my password.<br>
            i did two weeks of my website and pushed it. next class we created oobleck, the process of making it was very easy but we made a few mistakes our biggest mistake was putting the food coloring in when the oobleck was too thick so it wouldnt mix<br>
            another problem we faced was not knowing the ideal consistancy for the ooblec so we didnt know how close we were to getting it right. seeing other groups that added too much water made us fearfull of overwatering it so we played it safe.<br>
