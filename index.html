            <i> 8/20/23 </i> My name is Ronan Fisher and this is my epic journal entree about my experiences in engeering.<br>
            This first week started with me and my fellow classmates indulging in a challenge of wits.<br>
            The purpose of the challenge was to test our ability to work as a team to achieve s single goal. <br>
            The objectve was to roll a marble into a bucket without it rolling backwords using only short half cut pvc pipes. <br>
            We started great being far ahead of the opposing team, almost getting to the bucket every time.<br>
            To our dismay the other team suddenly improoved at a rapid rate causing us to panic which gave them the advantage resulting in our defeat.<br>
            Even though we lost it was a great lesson to us on why it is important to learn from our mistakes.<br>
            our mistake was that every time we got close to the bucket the person in charge would not angle the ramp properly so it would just miss. <br>

            <i> 8/27/23 </i> This is my seccond week of school and it consisted of learning tinkercad,, mechanical engeneering, and drafting our rude goldberg machiene. <br>
            We learned about machanical engineering which i don't remember much of, but im sure we learnt about the uses and the different organizations. <br>
            I was absent for the day we learnt about the tinkercad, but that does'nt matter because i already have experience with it from another class. <br>
            The idea for our rude goldberg machiene was my idea and i thought of it because the last project i bult was a roller coater and it was kind of similar. <br>
